ljQuery
=======

super-lightweight jQuery implementation

the purpose of the whole thing was to learn a bunch of things about
OOP and closures in javascript.

Please see the demo. 
Supports selectors as IDs, classes or tag names.
Also supports chaining and some basic methods like show(), hide(), setColor(),
setBackgroundColor(), setContent(),...
and a general method setStyle() that can set any css style.

You can add your own method very easily to complement the missing functionality
since all the functions above were written in a single line of code - 
you just need to follow the pattern ;-)
